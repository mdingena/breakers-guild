# Services

The Breakers Guild represents both member and affiliate ship-breakers. Contracts will be dealt with on a per-case basis, but while the Guild has skilled members, realistically most contracts are fulfilled by its affiliates.

## Salvage

Our primary service is **salvaging** vehicles wrecked by the perils of deep space. This includes:

* towing immobilised vehicles
* siphoning fuel, oxygen and water
* reclaiming vehicle components
* scraping hull externals
* recycling vehicle materials

[Contact us](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/BREAKER) to discuss the terms of your salvaging operation.

## Repair & Restoration

While our focus is on dismantling incapacitated vehicles, most breakers have a mechanics background. Our **repair and restoration** service can restore your vehicles from various degrees of disrepair.

## Search & Rescue

In rare situations the Guild performs **Search & Rescue** services. In almost all cases, this is a direct result of discovering surviving passengers onboard a vehicle originally designated for salvaging. **Guild breakers always prioritise lives over profit.**
