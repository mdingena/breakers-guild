# Manifesto

**Breaking is hard.** Every day, ship-breakers face incredibly hazardous environments performing their job. Whether it's the cold void of space, toxic fumes, or lethal cutting equipment, breakers put their safety on the line for a sustainable future.

**Breakers play an important role in the economy.** As boundless as the 'verse may seem, resources are precious and finite. It's vital to recycle and reuse these as much as possible. Breakers are able to grant your vehicles a second life by repairing them, salvaging their components, or extracting their raw materials.

**But who looks out for the breakers?** Who ensures they can work safely and receive fair compensation? Without an independent union that protects them, corporations can take advantage of breakers as they please.

**The Breakers Guild is an institution operated by and for ship-breakers.** It's an academy to guide aspiring breakers, and a labour union for providing mutual aid and protection and for dealing collectively with employers.

> **We help breakers across the 'verse execute their vocation with pride, precision and efficiency.**
> 
> **It is our mission to provide breakers with essential salvaging knowledge and equipment.**
