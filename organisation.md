# Organisation

To conduct business as an organisation, the Guild is divided into the following departments.

## Intelligence

The **Intelligence** department's task is to gather information on viable sources of income. They **buy wreck site locations** from agents in the field and **send scouting parties** to find new salvaging opportunities.

## Operations

At the heart of the Guild is the **Operations** department, which ensures the organisation's continuity by producing revenue and resources. They **provide live training scenarios** for aspirant breakers, **pursue lucrative [salvaging](/services?id=salvage) and [repairing](/services?id=repair-amp-restoration) contracts**, and **respond to [search & rescue](/services?id=search-amp-rescue) incidents**.

## Discipline

To some, ship-breaking is considered a form of art. The **Discipline** department monitors all activities related to the ship-breaking vocation. It defines and advocates the [Breaker's Code](/conduct/introduction), formalising the way the Guild expects breakers to accomplish their tasks.

## Security

A small but vital department of the organisation, **Security** provides escort for our members and equipment. Considering its size, this department only escorts the Guild's internal operations.
